The project involves a MERN stack blog application. The project includes various pages such as the homepage and the about page. Key functionalities have been implemented, such as loading articles, displaying them, allowing users to upvote articles using an upvote button, and enabling users to add comments through a dedicated comment form. Additionally, user authentication has been implemented, allowing users to log in and out of the application. This ensures proper identification of users when adding comments and restricts the number of upvotes each user can give to an article.
